Here is a clear and comprehensive timeline roadmap with checkboxes to build the MVP for your logistics SaaS:

### MVP Build Timeline Roadmap

#### Phase 1: Planning & Requirements (1-2 weeks)
- [ ] Define core user personas and logistics business segments
- [ ] List out must-have MVP features (order management, shipment tracking, basic routing, user roles)
- [ ] Design data models and APIs for core entities (orders, shipments, users)
- [ ] Plan multi-tenant architecture and data isolation strategy
- [ ] Choose technology stack (backend framework, database, frontend tools, hosting)

#### Phase 2: Backend Development (3-4 weeks)
- [ ] Setup project structure and development environment
- [ ] Implement user registration, authentication, and role-based access control
- [ ] Build order management API endpoints (CRUD operations)
- [ ] Develop shipment tracking and status update APIs
- [ ] Create basic route planning service and API
- [ ] Implement multi-tenancy logic for data segregation
- [ ] Setup database schemas and indexing for performance
- [ ] Integrate notifications and alert system (email, SMS or in-app)
- [ ] Write unit and integration tests for backend APIs

#### Phase 3: Frontend Development (3-4 weeks, parallel with backend)
- [ ] Setup frontend project and folder structure
- [ ] Create login/signup pages with auth integration
- [ ] Build dashboard with key metrics and active shipment overview
- [ ] Develop order management UI (order creation, status updates)
- [ ] Implement shipment tracking visualization (map or list view)
- [ ] Build route planning interface with basic optimization display
- [ ] Add role-based UI elements for dispatchers, drivers, admins
- [ ] Implement notification UI components
- [ ] Conduct frontend testing for user flows and responsiveness

#### Phase 4: Integration & Testing (2 weeks)
- [ ] Connect frontend with backend APIs fully
- [ ] Test multi-tenant data isolation on frontend and backend
- [ ] Conduct end-to-end testing of core workflows (order to delivery)
- [ ] Fix bugs and performance bottlenecks
- [ ] Pilot testing with a small group of real users/businesses for feedback

#### Phase 5: Deployment & Onboarding (1 week)
- [ ] Setup production environment and CI/CD pipelines
- [ ] Deploy backend and frontend apps to hosting/cloud
- [ ] Prepare onboarding materials and product guides for MVP users
- [ ] Conduct onboarding sessions with pilot users

#### Phase 6: Feedback & Iteration (Ongoing post-MVP)
- [ ] Collect user feedback and feature requests
- [ ] Monitor usage metrics and error reports
- [ ] Plan feature enhancements and bug fixes based on data

***

This roadmap follows a logical progression from planning to deployment, balancing backend and frontend work in parallel where possible, and emphasizes testing and user validation to ensure the MVP delivers solid foundational value for logistics businesses.
