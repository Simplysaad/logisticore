- Implement order import and shipping label generation automation.
- Add multi-carrier selection and dispatch logic.
- Build simple onboarding forms for e-commerce merchants.

## Week 6: Testing & Refinement
- Conduct end-to-end functional testing of core flows (order placement to delivery).
- Perform security checks (authentication, data isolation).
- Fix bugs, improve UI responsiveness and user experience.
- Start preparing deployment pipelines (CI/CD).

## Week 7: Deployment & Documentation
- Deploy backend and frontend to cloud hosting (AWS, Render, etc.).
- Set up domain and SSL certificates.
- Prepare onboarding guides, FAQs, and developer docs.
- Invite early beta testers for real-world feedback.

## Week 8: Beta Launch & Monitoring

- Monitor platform metrics, user activity, errors.
- Collect feedback and prioritize critical improvements.
- Plan for next phase development (advanced features, scaling).

### Key Notes:
- Dedicate full days or focused hours weekly to frontend, backend, and integration tasks.
- Use Agile iterations: develop small increments and test continuously.
- Defer advanced features like route optimization, chatbots, and analytics to post-MVP.
- Use third-party services (e.g., Cloudinary for storage, Twilio for SMS) to speed up development.
- Automate deployment early to enable frequent updates.

This timeline is tailored for efficient solo development while delivering a production-ready MVP that fulfills your core logistics SaaS goals within 2 months.
